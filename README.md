# BATMAN-PCB
Battery Management PCB for V3 Rover
BATMAN is a rover battery management PCB for a 12S (or 2x6S) lithium pack. It continuously monitors and reports per cell voltage, pack current, pack temperature, and state of charge over CAN. It protects the pack using MOSFET cutoff and fault codes for overcurrent and short circuit, cell overvoltage and undervoltage, and over temperature and under temperature conditions. It also supports cell balancing and low power behavior for long term battery connection. The board is a 6 layer JLCPCB design, about 180 mm by 120 mm, mounted to the chassis using 8 M3 holes (hole centers about 5 mm from the board edge), with up to 50 mm height clearance for tall components and connector access. Charging uses a harness terminating in a 19436 0413 header. 
# Project Description
See Project Spec in files, very detailed and outlines everything needed to be known about the board (Firmware info, design characteristics, features etc.)
